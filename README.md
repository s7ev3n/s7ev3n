### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am s7ev3n. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Research Scientist focusing on 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving at BOSCH Research. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently very interested in LLM Agents, developing a project called `sine` which is my wish to have a personal AI mentor.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently learning frontend and backend stuff (making `sine` better), if you are interested in `sine` and good at frontend and backend stuff, let us talk :)
